# Healthcare-Risk-Detection-AI
Healthcare Risk Detection AI using scikit learning and cuda, This is for project and completely experimental.

Welcome, please if you want to run the code read this step by step.
1. run preproccessing to get data from csv file. You can try to use another files if you have, but make sure there is an age and blood pressure data exist.
2. Then you can run main which trains the model in linear regression. Or Use cuda to train gradient descent approach
3. Finally Analise how cpu performs compared to gpu.
